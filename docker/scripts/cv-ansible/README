This directory contains Ansible configs for launching CV Linux slaves
which are hosted on separate VMs.

restart_cv_dockerslaves.yml - this is an Ansible playbook which does
the necessary steps to restart a single slave on port 2222 of a VM.

inventory - this is an Ansible inventory which specifies the current
set of VMs for these CV slaves, along with their cv.jenkins slave names.

restart_cv_dockerslaves.sh - this is a shell script which is intended
to be run inside a Docker container configured with Ansible. It simply
invokes ansible-playbook, specifying the above files as inputs. It
expects this current directory to be mounted as /mnt. See
../restart_cv_builders.sh for how this is used.

slave-setup.yml - this is an Ansible playbook which configures a
blank Ubuntu 16.04 VM to serve as an Ansible-controlled Docker host.
This is mostly for reference; it was run originally to configure the
hosts listed in "inventory", and could be run again in future to
configure new hosts. There is nothing CV-specific about this; any
VM intended for Docker could be configured this way.
